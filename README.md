# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Case-Study

- Predicting if the cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant based on several observations/features 
- 30 features are used, examples:
        1. radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
        2. texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
        3. perimeter
        4. area
        5. smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
        6. compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
        7. concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
        8. concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
        9. symmetry 
        10. fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

- Datasets are linearly separable using all 30 input features
- Number of Instances: 569
- Class Distribution: 212 Malignant, 357 Benign
- Target class:
         - Malignant
         - Benign
